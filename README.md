My emacs configuration settings.  

I've stored them in .emacs.d on my machine, since emacs creates that anyway.  

Unless otherwise noted this software has been authored by me.  (If
there are any oversights please let me know, I've tried to document
all code I've borrowed from the Emacs Wiki and blogs and such.)
